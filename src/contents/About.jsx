                      Founded in 2005 by coffee aficionados Janie and Markinz Yrnolds, Energize Coffee House has been a labor of love from the very beginning. What started as a cozy neighborhood cafe has evolved into a thriving hub for coffee enthusiasts, creatives, and friends. Our journey began with a simple vision: to serve the finest coffee in a warm, inviting space that fosters connection and creativity.
